<h4>Resources</h4>

<ul>
<li>Electron <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/">website</a> including an awesome tutorial. Probably the best single source of information on Electron.</li>
<li>Brad Traversy of Traversy Media has published a relatively recent video tutorial: <a href="https://youtu.be/ML743nrkMHw">Create a Desktop App with Electron</a> (2022) </li>
<li>The apps here were developed as part of a course on Udemy; "Electron: Complete Developer's Guide" by Stephen Grider.  However, the course code was developed in 2017 and is no longer functional at this time.  Code in this repository, written in 2023, follows concepts from that course but differs substantially in content.  For example, the course used Electron version 1 while the material herein uses Electron version 23.</li>
